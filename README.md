# LinkedIn Profile Scraping Project

**This project is under development.** It is hosted with GitHub Pages. The backend will be developed using FastAPI, and we are utilizing LangChain, Selenium, Jinja, and other tools for backend processing. The LLM calls will be made via third-party services (not Ollama). You can see the demo by clicking the link below. Feel free to contribute!

Before starting, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can do this by installing the packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrashansaSoni/Resume_builder.git
    cd Resume_builder/backend
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the scraping script:**

    This step will be implemented later on, based on the backend(FastAPI/something else)

5. **View the results:**

    After scraping, the data will be saved as an HTML file. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the results.
